## Description

WAVFORM is an commerce site with a focus of selling Sound Packs and Synth Presets to be used in electronic music production. The project was built with Typescript and TailwindCSS using version 13.4 Next.js, giving us the now stable App Router.

## Features

- Next.js 13 [App Router] (https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4#nextjs-app-router)
- Next.js [Server Components] (https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4#server-actions-alpha)
- [Swell] (https://swell.is/) Commerce Storefront
- [Stripe] (https://stripe.com/) secure payments
- Cart Slider Component from [Headless UI] (https://headlessui.com/)

## Swell

Swell allows us to maintain a storefront using their admin dashboard, where products can be uploaded and maintained. For this project I added 6 Sound Packs that I create using XFer Records' [Serum Synthesizer] (https://xferrecords.com/products/serum). I created a cover image for each Sound Pack and uploaded them as products to my Swell Admin account along with a name, description, and cost. The Swell API also gives us access to cart functionality and secure stripe payments, streamlining the checkout process.
